                <h1> Powerful download engine </h1>
                <h3> Our powerful download engine uses unique algorithms
                to receive Internet data in a fastest possible way. IDM
                will accelerate downloads all times because of its innovative
                dynamic file segmentation technology. Unlike other download managers
                and accelerators, IDM segments downloaded files dynamically during
                download process, and it reuses available connections without
                additional connect and login stages to achieve the best possible
                acceleration performance. Our engineers have a lot of experience in
                download acceleration, and we constantly improve this download engine
                since 1999. </h3>
