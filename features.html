                <h3> Internet Download Manager will accelerate downloads
                     by up to 5 times due to its smart dynamic file
                     segmentation technology. Unlike other download
                     managers and accelerators, Internet Download
                     Manager segments downloaded files dynamically
                     during download process, and it reuses available
                     connections without additional connect and login
                     stages to achieve the best possible acceleration
                     performance.</h3>

                     supplemental mode to a default (or light) theme.
                     The dark theme reduces the luminance emitted by
                     your screen, while still meeting minimum color
                     contrast ratios. It helps to improve visual
                     ergonomics by reducing eye strain, adjusting
                     brightness to current lighting conditions, and
                     facilitating screen use in dark environments
                     while conserving power. </h3>

                <h1> Dynamic segmentation </h1>
                <h3> Internet Download Manager has optimized file download
                     logic. IDM divides downloaded file on file segments
                     dynamically, unlike other download accelerators that
                     divide downloaded file in segments once just before
                     download process starts. Dynamic segmentation gives
                     significant download performance improvement. When
                     file download starts, it's unclear how many connections
                     may be opened. When new connection becomes available
                     IDM finds the largest segment to download and divide
                     it in half. Thus new connection starts downloading file
                     from the half of the largest file segment. IDM minimizes
                     the time needed for negotiations with servers and keeps
                     all connections busy. </h3>

                     or shut down your computer when it's done. You can also
                     synchronize changes using periodic synchronization of
                     files. It's possible to create and schedule several
